This compressed folder provides the R codes for the readers to replicate the results in the simulation studies and illustrative VACS data example. It contains 4 subfolders: “Simulation 1”, “Simulation 2”, “Simulation 3” and “VACS”. 

1, Subfolder “Simulation 1”
This folder includes the R codes for the simulation studies when the linear model and logistic regression model can hold simultaneously. 
“logit_T.R”: codes for Table 1
“logit_P.R”: codes for Table 3
“plot_script.R”: codes for Figure 1
“Time.R”: codes for Table 4

2, Subfolder “Simulation 2”
This folder includes the R codes for simulation studies in Scenario I where the linear model and logistic regression model can not hold simultaneously. 
“logit_T.R”: codes for lower panel of Table 2 and Supplementary Material Table S2
“logit_P.R”: codes for lower panel of Supplementary Material Table S5
“linear_T.R”: codes for upper panel of Table 2 and Supplementary Material Table S2
“linear_P.R”: codes for upper panel of Supplementary Material Table S5

3, Subfolder “Simulation 3”
This folder includes the R codes for simulation studies in Scenario I where the linear model and logistic regression model can not hold simultaneously. 
“logit_Tskew.R”: codes for lower panel of Supplementary Material Table S3 and S4
“logit_Pskew.R”: codes for lower panel of Supplementary Material Table S6
“linear_Tskew.R”: codes for upper panel of Supplementary Material Table S3 and S4
“linear_Pskew.R”: codes for upper panel of Supplementary Material Table S6

4, Subfolder “VACS”
This folder contains the R codes for implementing the illustrative VACS data example.
“spline200117.R”: codes for Table 5 and Figure 2.
